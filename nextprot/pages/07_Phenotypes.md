# Phenotypes

Since neXtProt 2.0 (released in September 2016), the RDF model has evolved to express phenotypes related to variants.

A variant can be seen as an isoform that have been modified. An isoform containing this modification is called a proteoform.

The following model shows how the model is designed.

One can ask for example: Proteins with a variant having an impact on the nucleus localization at level GOLD

These examples are not yet available on the neXtProt playground, but can be found on the production website.
